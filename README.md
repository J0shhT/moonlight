# Project Moonlight

Project Moonlight is an i386 kernel created as a learning experience using the resources from the [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/) community. This project is hardly complete and unstable for use as a real kernel for a computer. The kernel has been tested on both emulators & virtual machines as well as on real hardware.

**WARNING:** Do not run this kernel or use the code on any real hardware unless you are okay with the *risk of damaging your computer* in the case of any bugs in it.
